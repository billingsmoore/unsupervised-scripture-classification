THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-
ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapiD<;lika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this:
2. "Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the restraint of
all the taints. 32 [7] Listen and attend closely to what I shall say."
- "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One
said this
Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one
who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and see.
Who knows and sees what? Wise attention and unwise atten-
tion. 33 When one attends unwisely, una risen taints arise and
arisen taints increase. When one attends wisely, unarisen taints
do not arise and arisen taints are abandoned.
4. "Bhikkhus, there are taints that should be abandoned by
seeing. There are taints that should be abandoned by restrain-
ing. There are taints that should be abandoned by using. There
are taints that should be abandoned by enduring. There are
taints that should be abandoned by avoiding. There are taints
that should be abandoned by removing. There 
What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by seeing?35
Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who has no
regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their
92 Sabbllsava Sutta: Sutta 2 i 8
Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and
undisciplined in their Dhamma, does not understand what
things are fit for attention and what things are unfit for atten-
tion. Since that is so, he attends to those things unfit for atten-
tion and he does not attend to those things fit for attention.36
6. "What are the things unfit for attention that he attends to?
They are things such that when he attends to them, the unarisen
taint of sensual desire arises in him and the arisen taint of
sensual desire increases, the una risen taint of being arises in him
and the arisen taint of being increases, the unarisen taint of igno-
rance arises in him and the arisen taint of ignorance increases.
These are the things unfit for attention that he attends to.37 And
what are the things fit for attention that he does not attend to?
They are things such that when he attends to them, the una risen
taint of sensual desire does not arise in him and the arisen taint
of sensual desire is abandoned, the unarisen taint of being does
not arise in him and the arisen taint of being is abandoned,the
unarisen taint of ignorance does not arise in him and the arisen
taint ~f ignorance is abandoned. These are the things fit for
atte~tlOn that ~e does not attend to. [8] By attending to things
~nflt for attentIon and by not attending to things fit for atten-
tIon, both unarisen taints arise in him and arisen taints increase.
7.."This is how he attends unwisely: 'Was I in the past? Was I
not ~ the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past?
Havmg been what, what did I become in the past? Shall I be in
the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the
future? How shall I be in th'e future? Having been what, what
shall I become in the future?' Or else he is inwardly perplexed
about the present thus: 'Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I?
Where has this being come from? Where will it gO?'38
8. "When he attends unwisely in this way, one of six views
arises in him. 39 The view 'self exists for me' arises in him as true
and established; or the view 'no self exists for me' arises in him
as true and established; or the view 'I perceive self with self
arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I perceive not-
self with self' arises in him as true and established; or the view 'I
perceive self with not-self' arises in him as true and established;
or else he has some such view as this: 'It is this self of mine
that speaks and feels and experiences here and there the result
of good and bad actions; but this self of mine is permanent,

everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and it wi~l endure as
long as eterruty.'40 This speculative vie~, bhikkhus, IS call~d the
thicket of views, the wilderness of VIews, the contortIon of
viewS, the vacillation of views, the fetter of views. Fettered by
the fetter of views, the untaught ordinary person is not freed
from birth, ageing, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain,
grief, and despair; he is not freed from suffering, I say.
9. "Bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for
noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dharnma, who
has regard for true men and is skilled and . disciplined. in their
Dhamma, understands what things are fIt for attentIon and
what things are unfit for attention. Since that is so, [9] he does
not attend to those things unfit for attention and he attends to
L
those things fit for attention. .
10. "What are the things unfit for attention that he does not
attend to? They are things such that when he attends to them,
the una risen taint of sensual desire arises in him .. .(as ยง6) ... and
the arisen taint of ignorance increases. These are the things unfit
for attention that he does not attend to. And what are the things
fit for attention that he attends to? They are things such that
when he attends to them, the unarisen taint of sensual desire
does not arise in him ... (as ยง6) .. . and the arisen taint of ignorance
is abandoned. These are the things fit for attention that he
attends to. By not attending to things unfit for attention and by
attending to things fit for attention, unarisen taints do not arise
in him and arisen taints are abandoned.
11. "He attends wisely: 'This is suffering'; he attends wisely:
'This is the origin of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the
cessation of suffering'; he attends wisely: 'This is the way lead-
ing to the cessation of suffering.'41 When he attends wisely in
this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: personality view,
doubt and adherence to rules and observances. These are called
the taints that should be abandoned by seeing.
12. "What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by restrain-
ing?43 Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, abides with the eye fac-
ulty restrained. While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in
94 Sabbiisava Sutta: Sutta 2 i 10
taints, vexation, or fever in one who abides with the eye faculty
restrained. 44 Reflecting wisely, he abides with the ear faculty
restrained ... with the nose faculty restrained ... with the tongue fac-
ulty restrained ... with the body faculty restrained ... with the mind
faculty restrained ... While taints, vexation, and fever might arise
in one who abides with the faculties unrestrained, [10] there are
no taints, vexation, or fever in one who abides with the faculties
restrained. These are called the taints that should be abandoned
by restraining.
(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY USING)
13. "What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by using?4S
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, uses the robe only for protec-
tion from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from con-
tact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping
things, and only for the purpose of concealing the private parts.
14. "Reflecting wisely, he uses almsfood neither for amusement
nor for intoxication nor for the sake of physical beauty and attrac-
tiveness, but only for the endurance and continuance of this body,
for ending discomfort, and for assisting the holy life, considering:
'Thus I shall terminate old feelings without arousing new feelings
and I shall be healthy and blameless and shall live in comfort.'
15. "Reflecting wisely, he uses the resting place only for pro-
tection from cold, for protection from heat, for protection from
contact with gadflies, mo~quitoes, wind, the sun, and creeping
things, and only for the purpose of warding off the perils of cli-
mate and for enjoying retreat.
16. "Reflecting wisely, he uses the medicinal requisites only
for protection from arisen afflicting feelings and for the benefit
of good health.
17. "While taints, vexation, and fever might arise in one who
does not use the requisites thus, there are no taints, vexation, or
fever in one who uses them thus. These are called the taints that
should be abandoned by using.
What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by enduring?
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, bears cold and heat, hunger and

thirst, and contact with gadflies, mosquitoes, wind, the sun, and
creeping things; he endures ill~spoken, unwelcome ~o~ds a~d
arisen bodily feelings that are p~, ra~king, s~arp,. plercmg, ~lS
agreeable, distressing, and menacmg to life. While tamts, vexa~on,
and fever might arise in one who does not endure such things,
there are no taints, vexation, or fever in one who endures ~em.
These are called the taints that should be abandoned by endurmg.
(TAINTS TO BE ABANOONED BY AVOIDING)
19. "What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by avoid~g?
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, avoids a wild elephant, a wlld
horse, a wild bull, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, ~1l] a ?ramble
patch, a chasm, a cliff, a cesspit, a sewer. Re~ectmg w1Se~y, he
avoids sitting on unsuitable seats, wandenng to unsUltable
resorts,46 and associating with bad friends, since if he ,:ere to d?
so wise companions in the holy life might su~pect h~m ?f evil
conduct. While taints, vexation, and fever mIght anse 111 one
who does not avoid these things, there are no taints, vexa~on,
and fever in one who avoids them. These are called the tamts
that should be abandoned by avoiding.
(TAINTS TO BE ABANDONED BY REMOVING)
. ?
20. "What taints, bhikkhus, should be abandoned by removmg.
Here a bhikkhu, reflecting wisely, does not tolerate an arisen
thought of sensual desire; he abandons it, removes it, does away
with it and annihilates it. He does not tolerate an arisen thought
of ill'will ... He does not tolerate an arisen thought of
cruelty ... He does not tolerate arisen evil unw~olesome states; h~
abandons them removes them, does away WIth them, and anru-
hilates them. 47 ~le taints, vexation, and fever might arise in
one who does not remove these thoughts, there are no taints,
vexation, or fever in one who removes them. These are called
the taints that should be abandoned by removing.

ing in SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, Anathapi1:\(;iika's Park. There he
addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."sl - "Venerable sir,"
they replied. The Blessed One said this: .. .
2. "Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heIrS In matenal
things. Out of compassion for you I have thoug~t: '.How sh~ll
my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heIrS In ma~en~l
things?' If you are my heirs in material things, not ~y ~eI~s In
Dhamma, you will be reproached thus: 'The Teacher s dIscIples
live as his heirs in material things, not as heirs in Dhamma'; and
I will be reproached thus: 'The Teacher's disciples live as his
heirs in material things, not as his heirs in Dhamma.'
"If you are my heirs in Dhamma, not .my ~eirs in .mat;rial
things, you will not be reproached [as It WIll be saId): T~e
Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heIrS
in material things'; and I will not be reproached [as it will be
said]: 'The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, ~ot
as his heirs in material things.' Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heIrs
in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassi~n
for you I have thought: 'How shall my disciples be my heirs In
/ Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?'
3. "Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more
food, had my fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and
some almsfood was left over to be thrown away. Then two
bhikkhus arrived [13] hungry and weak, and I told them:
'Bhikkhus, I have eaten ... had what I needed, but there is this
almsfood of mine left over to be thrown away. Eat if you like; if
you do not eat then I shall throw it away where there is no
greenery or drop it into water where there is no life.' Then one
bhikkhu thought: 'The Blessed One has eaten ... had what he
97
/
98 Dhammadayada Sutta: Sutta 3 i 14
needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to
be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it
away ... But this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkh b
hยท . Oha us, e
my eirs I~ mma, not my heirs in material things." Now this
al~foo~ IS one of the material things. Suppose that instead of
eatin? this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak.'
And InStead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day
hungry and weak. Then the second bhikkhu thought: 'The Blessed
One has eaten ... had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of
th~ Blessed One left over to be thrown away ... Suppose that I eat
thIS almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor
weak.' ~nd after eating that almsfood he passed the night and
da~ neIther hungry nor weak. Now although that bhikkhu by
eating that almsfo?d passed the night and day neither hungry
nor weak, yet the flISt bhikkhu is more to be respected and com-
me~ded by me. Why is that? Because that will for long conduce
to his fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, easy support,
and arousal of ener.gy .. 52 Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in
Ohamma, not my heIrS m material things. Out of compassion for
you I have thought: 'How shall my disciples be my heirs in
Ohamma, ~ot my heirs in material things?'"
4 ..That IS what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the
SublIme One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling. Soon
after he had left, the venerable Sariputta addressed the bhikkh
thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." - "Friend," they replied. [14] T~;
venerable Sariputta said this:

remember it."

third reason. The new bhikkhus are to be commended for these
three reasons.
"It is in this way that disciples of the Teacher who lives
secluded train in seclusion.

That is what the venerable Sariputta said. The bhikkhus were
satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sariputta's words.
1. THUS HAVE I HEARD. On one occasion the Blessed One was liv-
ing at SavatthI in Jeta's Grove, AnathapU:t9ik a's Park.
2. Then the brahmin JaI).ussoI)i56 went to the Blessed One and
exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and ami-
able talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said: "Master
Gotama, when clansmen have gone forth from the home life into
homelessness out of faith in Master Gotama, do they have
Master Gotama for their leader, their helper, and their guide?
And do these people follow the example of Master Gotama?"57
"That is so, brahmin, that is so. When clansmen have gone
forth from the home life into homelessness out of faith in me
they have me for their leader, their helper, and their guide. And
these people follow my example."
"But, Master Gotama, remote jungle-thicket resting places in
the forest are hard to endure, seclusion is hard to practise, and it
is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles must rob
a bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration." [17]
"That is so, brahmin, that is so. Remote jungle-thicket resting
places in the forest are hard to endure, seclusion is hard to prac-
tise, and it is hard to enjoy solitude. One would think the jungles
must rob a bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.
3. "Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unen-
lightened Bodhisatta, I too considered thus: 'Remote jungle-thick-
et resting places in the forest are hard to endure ... the jungles
must rob a bhikkhu of his mind, if he has no concentration.'
4. "I considered thus: 'Whenever recluses or brahmins unpuri-
fied in bodily conduct resort to remote jungle-thicket resting
places in the forest, then owing to the defect of their unpurified
bodily conduct these good recluses and brahmins evoke
unwholesome fear and dread. But I do not resort to remote jun-
gle-thicket resting places in the forest unpurified in bodi~y con-
duct. I am purified in bodily conduct. I resort to remote Jung~e
thicket resting places in the forest as one of the noble ones WIth
bodily conduct purified.' Seeing in myself this purity of bodily
conduct, I found great solace in dwelling in the forest.
